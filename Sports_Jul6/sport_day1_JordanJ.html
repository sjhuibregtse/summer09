<p>Game 1

<p>Saturday, July 8, 2009

<p>Opponent:  Sennett Stars

<p>The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine Saturday afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to bring Gatorade for the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.</p>  

<p>Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't score, and the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then scored 2 runs on a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, a single that drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings went by with no more runs.  Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him to third.  Melannie hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home.</p> 

<p>Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the entire game), but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game.  The next two innings were not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run. Then, in the final inning, the Star's main pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!  4 runs later, the final score was:</p>

<p>Wildcats: 7</p>
<p>Stars: 3</p>
