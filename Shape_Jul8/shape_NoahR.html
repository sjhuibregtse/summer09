<h2>About This Shape</h2>
	<h4> After one rainy day in Belgium people look out there window and discover that a rainbow is in the sky.
	 They look at the rainbow and see that something is very, very wrong. They see that the rainbow is 
	 in a wierd shape like the one you see above the text. The raibow is now a bunch of big lines.
	 The townsfolks take a closer look at the rainbow and see that there are three rainbows in the sky!
	 "This is very unusual." said Tommy Parker the towns policeman. "It must of rained a lot to get three
	 rainbows."said Gorge Smith (The famous sailor). "I belive," said Frank Fidgle "That some fraction 
     molequle in the air caused a reaction with the sky to make the rainbow into a wierd shape." 
	 All the children loved the new rainbow and said that it was the best rainbow in the world.
	 I asked kids what they think happend to make the rainbow, and belive me they came up with 
	 some wacky ideas. Tom Caron said that he thought aliens did it. Rachel Benatrix said that a pony did it. 
	 The mystery gose on though and peope are still wondering what caused the rainbow to make that
	 funny shape? 
	 Mabey we'll find out next time on Noah's News Network.
