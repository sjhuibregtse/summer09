				Learning can be more exciting when you use technology. Using the Internet, creating web pages, and
				animating characters, will improve your reading, writing, and research skills in a very fun way!
				This is a new summer program for 3rd â€“ 6th graders that should be totally cool. Come and join us
				as we venture through the "World of Computer Science".
			</p>
			<p>
				This summer school program is offered at Cedar Grove-Belgium Elementary School:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				50 W. Union Avenue,<br />
				Cedar Grove, WI  53013<br />

			<h2>Who is Ms. Sarah Huibregtse?</h2>
			<p>
				I've been a teacher since 2001, and a Computer Science teacher since starting at the Madison School District in 
				2005. With a Bachelor's degree from Lakeland College in Elementary Education I taught 4th grade for 3 great years
				at Cedar Grove-Belgium Elementary School. I then received my Masters in Computer Science Education from Cardinal
				Stritch University to extend my Computer Science certification through high school.  I recently completed a 
				certificate in Web Site Development from Madison Area Technical College and I am currently working on updating
				my Microsoft Office Certification to Office 2007.
			</p>
			<p>
				While teaching at New Berlin I taught Computer Science Exploratory (HTML, Scratch, and Alice) to middle school
				students, as well as Introduction to Programming (Alice and Visual Basic), Web Design I (XTHML), II (XHTML and JavaScript),
				III (Beginning Dreamweaver, Flash, and Photoshop Elements), and IV (Advanced Dreamweaver, Flash, and Photoshop Elements),
				and AP Computer Science A (Alice and Java) to high school students. I was also the faculty advisor for New Berlin West's
				Modern Arts and Technology Club where we worked with the GameMaker program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, I teach Information Technology courses for Madison Area Technical College and have taught Microsoft
				Access 2007 and Careers in IT. I was also the administrator, faculty support, and trainer for New Berlin
				School District's Moodle site, which is an Online Course Management System.  I am one of two 
				teachers representing Wisconsin as a member of the Computer Science Teacher Association's Leadership Cohort.  For two
				years I was also the Assistant Cross Country coach at Eisenhower Middle/High School.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I enjoy running, biking (road & mountain),
				traveling, reading, computers, creating Web sites, digital photography (Flickr, WebShots), gardening, and playing with my cat
				(Tigger).
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to teaching I served in the United States Navy onboard the USS Mount Hood (AE-29), and in the Army National Guard
				with the 32nd Military Police Company. I also spent a few years traveling the country when I worked for a
				software company as a Training Specialist.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am looking forward to learning and growing with all of my students (and parents) as the summer progresses.
