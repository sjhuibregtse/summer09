		The Tigers were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine
		Saturday afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Bob was kind enough
		to bring Gatorade so they didn't get dehydrated, and Hocking Wolf bought snacks for the entire team, so they didn't get hungry.

	Sam pitched the first 3 innings.  The Stars put two men on base and
	 scored, and the Tigers went down 1, 2, 3. Coach Bob yelled from the sidelines "come on tigers you can do it!"   Not a good beginning.  
	The Stars then scored 3 runs on a  single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, 
	a single that drove 2 runs home.  Gorge got that last man out.  Two 
	innings went by with only 1 run.  Finally, John was walked and Carols's 
	single drove him to third.  Jane hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home, but Jane got out.

    <p align="justify">	
    Carol was on third.  Gorge struck out (the stars' 
	pitching was excellent the entire game), but Tommy got a 
	single and Carol came home to tie up the game. In the next two innings 
	Carol cought a fly ball and got 1 person out., but both teams 
	scored a single run.  Then, in the final inning, the Star's 
	main pitcher was at the pitching mound with a look of confidence on his 
	face! His team was winning by 3 points! The pitcher threw the ball, Tommy 
	swung his bat! WACK! The ball went over the fence! Tommy scored a home run!  
	The crowd went wild! Cotch Bob and Hocking Wolf were cheering for joy! 4 runs later, the final score was:
