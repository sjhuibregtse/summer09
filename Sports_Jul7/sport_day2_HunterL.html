	<h1>Game 1</h1>
	<h3>Saturday, July 8, 2009</h3>
	Opponent:  Sennett Stars
	<p>
	The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine 
	Saturday afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to 
	bring Gatorade for the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.
	</p>  
	<p>
	Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't 
	score, and the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then
	scored 2 runs on a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two
	men out, a single that drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings
	went by with no more runs.  Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him 
	to third.  Melannie hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home.
	</p> 
	<p>
	Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the 
	entire game), but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game. 
	The next two innings were not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  Then,
	in the final inning, the Star's main pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!
	4 runs later, the final score was:
	</p>

	Wildcats: 7<br />
	Stars: 3
