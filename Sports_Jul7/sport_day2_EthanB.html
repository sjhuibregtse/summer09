	<h1>Game 1</h1>
	<h3>Saturday, July 8, 2009</h3>
	<p>Opponent:  Sennett Stars</p>
	<p>
		The wildcats were the home field at muir field ,so the stars stated a fine saturday
		afternoon,sunny and not to hot.Coach Huibregtse kind enough to bring Gatorade for
		the entire team so we didn't get dehhydrated.

		Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't score,
		and the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then scored 2
		runs on a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, a
		single that drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings went by with
		no more runs.  Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him to third.  Melannie
		hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home. 
	</p> 
	<p>
	Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the entire game),
	but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game.  The next two innings were
	not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  Then, in the final inning, the Star's main
	pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!  4 runs later, the final score was:

	<p>Wildcats: 7<br />
