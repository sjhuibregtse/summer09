<p>
   The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine Saturday 
   afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to bring Gatorade for
   the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.
</p>  

<p>
   Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't score, and
   the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then scored 2 runs on a
   single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, a single that drove
   2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings went by with no more runs.  Finally,
   John was walked and Samuel's single drove him to third.  Melannie hit a solid hit to center 
   field, and John came home.
</p>
 

<p>
   Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the entire game)
   , but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game.  The next two innings were
   not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  Then, in the final inning, the Star's main
   pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!  4 runs later, the final score was:
</p>

<p>   Wildcats: 7<br />
      Stars: 3
