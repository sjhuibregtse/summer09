	<h1>Game 1</h1>
	<h3>Saturday, July 8, 2009</h3>
	<p>
		Opponent:  Sennett Stars
	</p>		
		<font face="Tahoma" >Batting Order:</font>
	 	<li><font  face="ArialBlack" >Helen</li>
		<li><font  face="ArialBlack" >John</li>
		<li><font  face="ArialBlack" >Samuel</li>

		The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine 
		Saturday afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to bring 
		Gatorade for the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.
	</p>  
	<p>
		Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't score, 
		and the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then scored 2 runs 
		on a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, a single that 
		drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings went by with no more runs. 
		Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him to third.  Melannie hit a solid hit 
		to center field, and John came home.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the entire game), 
		but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game.  The next two innings 
		were not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  Then, in the final inning, the 
		Star's main pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!  4 runs later, the final score was:
	</p>
	<p>
		Wildcats: 7<br />
		Stars: 3
