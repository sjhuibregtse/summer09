	<h4>Saturday, July 10, 2009</h4>
    <p>Opponent:  Sennett Stars</p>
	<h1><font color="blue" face="Agency FB">Game 1</font></h1>
    <p>
		The Big Cats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine
		Saturday afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough
		to bring Gatorade and snacks for the entire team, so they didn't get dehydrated or hungry.
	</p>
 <p>	
	Sam pitched the first 3 innings.  The Stars put two men on base and
	 scored, and the Big Cats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  
	The Stars then scored 3 runs on a  single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, 
	a single that drove 2 runs home.  Gorge got that last man out.  Two 
	innings went by with no more runs.  Finally, John was walked and Carols's 
	single drove him to third.  Jane hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home.
</p> 
<p>	Carol was on third.  Gorge struck out (the stars' 
	pitching was excellent the entire game), but Tommy got a 
	single and Carol came home to tie up the game. In the next two innings 
	Carol cought a fly ball and got 1 person out., but both teams 
	scored a single run.  Then, in the final inning, the Star's 
	main pitcher was at the pitching mound with a look of confidence on his 
	face! His team was winning by 3 points! The pitcher threw the ball, Tommy 
	swung his bat! WACK! The ball went over the fence! Tommy scored a home run!  
	4 runs later, the final score was:
</p>

	Big Cats: 7<br />
	Stars: 5<br />
