	Game 1
	</font></h1>
	<h3>Saturday, July 8, 2009</h3>
	<p>Opponent:  Sennett Stars</p>
	<p>
		The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine Saturday
	afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to bring Gatorade 
	for the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.
	</p>  
	<p>
		Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't score,
	and the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then scored 
	2 runs on a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out,
	a single that drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings went by
	with no more runs.  Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him to third. 
	Melannie hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the 
	entire game), but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game. 
	The next two innings were not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  
	Then, in the final inning, the Star's main pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats 
	went wild!  4 runs later, the final score was:
	</p>
	<p>
	Wildcats: 7<br />
	Stars: 3
