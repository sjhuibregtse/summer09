		The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine 
		Saturday afternoon, sunny and not too hot.  Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to
		bring Gatorade for the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't 
		score, and the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then 
		scored 2 runs on a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two 
		men out, a single that drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out. Two innings
		went by with no more runs. Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him 
		to third.  Melannie hit a solid hit to center field, and John came home.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent the entire
		game), but Elizabeth got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game.  The next
		two innings were not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  Then, in the
		final inning, the Star's main pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!  4 runs
		later, the final score was:
	</p>
	<p>
		Wildcats: 7<br />
		Stars: 3
