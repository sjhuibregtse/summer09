		 The Wildcats were the home team at Muir Field, so the Stars started on a fine Saturday 
		afternoon, sunny and not too hot. Coach Huibregtse was kind enough to bring Gatorade for
		 the entire team, so we didn't get dehydrated.
	</p>  
	<p>
		Helen pitched the first 5 innings.  The Stars put two men on base but didn't score, and 
		the Wildcats went down 1, 2, 3.  Not a good beginning.  The Stars then scored 2 runs on 
		a single, a walk, a single that filled the bases, and, after two men out, a single that 
		drove 2 runs home.  Helen got that last man out.  Two innings went by with no more runs. 
		 Finally, John was walked and Samuel's single drove him to third.  Melannie hit a solid 
		 hit to center field, and John came home.
	</p> 
	<p>
		 but Elizabeth Samuel was on third.  Andrew struck out (the stars' pitching was excellent
		 the entire game), got a single and Samuel came home to tie up the game.  The next two innings 
		 were not as exciting, but both teams scored a single run.  Then, in the final inning, the 
		 Star's main pitcher was replaced and the Wildcats went wild!  4 runs later, the final score
		 was:
	</p>
	<p>
		Wildcats: 7<br />
		Stars: 3
